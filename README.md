# odin-js-library
## The Odin Project - Library

Project completed as part of The Odin Project. First Javascript project in the Full Stack Ruby on Rails path. Create a small library app.

## Features:
 - Users can add books to the library by clicking the Add New Book button and submitting book information
 - Books can be marked as read or unread, including button to toggle status
 - Books can be deleted

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Javascript/HTML/CSS
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - ESLint

## What I learned:
 - This was the first project back in Javascript after spending a long time learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails, it took me a while to get the hang of javascript again
 - DOM manipulation and dynamically creating and changing elements
 - How to use event.preventDefault(); to stop a form from submitting data to the server

## Still can improve:
 - Did not add any styling to this, may revisit
 - My display books function is really long, think there may be a better way to implement this
 - I think I could revisit the update read status function, potentially create a toggleRead function on the book prototype
 - Add storage
 - Add additional fields (rating, genre, etc.)
